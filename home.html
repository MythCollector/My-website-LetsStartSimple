    <h1>Characters currently included</h1>
    <p> In all of these stories, a few main characters are included. <br> I'm here to introduce them to you!</p>
</div>
        <div id="Myth">
          <p>This is Myth. He is my OC, or original character. <br>  I have worked on the lore for him for almost a year now.<br> He is a big part of my life,and I have a lot of lore for him. I like to call him part of the lost critters. He looks like the rest of the critters, especially like catnap. He is Catnap, but with black fur and a sort of blue arua. <br> His eyes have a blue tint, and he can breath poppy gas, just like catnap, as well as being immune to it.</p>
      </div>
<div id="Iris">
    <p>This is Iris. She is another part of the lost critters. She is Myth's twin. She looks like the rest of the smiling critters, but an arctic fox. </p>
</div>
      <div id="Catnap">
          <p>You may already know catnap, but this isn't the catnap of how most people portay him. <br> In these stories, there are two. Theo, theo was the childs soul put into catnap so that catnap could live. In these stories, catnap is himself until theo takes over in part two.<br> Catnap was under mental control by the prototype, so he couldn't do anything. Catnap has the poppy gas as well, including the immunity.  </p>
